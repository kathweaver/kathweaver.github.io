According to the state of Texas, I'm a retired teacher.  I taught 23 years for Dallas ISD.

I currently teach computer science and web design for Johns Hopkins University, 
CTY Online Programs.  I have been with them for over 1 year.

I am working on an open source project, and have a few Windows Phone apps on the marketplace.

I also run beagles in agility -- Macy and Dulce.
