According to the state of Texas, I'm a retired teacher.  I taught 23 years for Dallas ISD.  I am certified to teach computer science, web design and mathematics.  I prefer computer science, web design second.  I also write curriculum for those subjects, and wrote most of the Dallas ISD curriculum.

I currently teach computer science and web design for Johns Hopkins University, CTY Online Programs.  I have been with them for over 1 year.  My students range in age from elementary taking Scratch, junior high taking web design and Scratch, senior high taking web design and Java.

I am working on an open source project  -- though stalled, and have a few Windows Phone apps on the marketplace.  I also support several websites, two for paying clients, hosting one, and the third for a non-profit of which I am on the board.

I also run beagles in agility -- Macy and Dulce.
