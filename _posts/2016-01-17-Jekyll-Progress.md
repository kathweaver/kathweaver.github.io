I hate it when someone says, don't worry about something. It's as if they threw a gauntlet down.

Oh, I know he probably didn't mean anything about it. I'm even assuming he's a guy. But it was
a guy thing to say.

So I'm working on Open LiveWriter, and they are moving the documentation to Jekyll.  A guy who
thinks he knows about it, said the above to me.

Then I'm testing stuff and guess what.

It doesn't work.

So I've set up my own Jekyll site, set up portable Jekyll that almost works.  

I keep thinking I need an Apple device or better yet a Linux box, and Jekyll is making me think 
that even more.

Anyway, I've managed to add Facebook to my Github page, do a couple of blog posts and becoming 
more and more comfortable with Markdown.
